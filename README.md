# A point grouping app

This is a simple machine learning application to show off the basics of TensorFlowJS
and SolidJS. It uses k-means (an unsupervised algorithm) to attempt to place points
into one of two groups based on their centroid. It's nothing fancy, but I wanted
a small application that ran in-browser that could help people get started with ML basics.
